/*
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rule for Kotlin variables are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names should start with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Names should start with a lowercase letter, and it cannot contain whitespace
Reserved words (like Kotlin keywords, such as var or String) cannot be used as names
Use - camelCase for variables
